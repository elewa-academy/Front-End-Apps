Here is an example Battle Ship project for you to study, broken into steps (slightly different steps from the ones you might choose to use).  

The largest difference you will notice between this demo and your project is that this demo does not have a 3 Layered Architecture.  If you find yourself struggling to complete a user story, consider refactoring Rien's code into 3 Layers as a starting point.
